    "When a research question is posed by a team, efficient communication and workflow can go a long way in making for a smooth process. I think the foundation of any good workflow should have the following: a person with a role in vetting data in order to ensure that the data we use to conduct our research is unbiased and comes from a reliable source. A person (or team of people) that use computational methods to understand the data better and eventually conduct the research that will yield an interesting result. Finally, it is important to have a person (or people) who is able to understand the methods and results of this research and effectively communicate these results to people unfamiliar with their research. Changes will be made and tracked through Github, a collaborative tool that uses version control to see past changes and revert to past versions if a new change breaks the code. Commits should track who made the changes, and what changes were made. This will show where a break in the code occurred, as well as improve communication on a team to understand other people's thoughts behind their methods. Branches are a great tool to allow multiple people on the team to work on their respective role in the project without fear of partially or completely breaking code. Once deemed appropriate, these branches can be merged with the master file."
